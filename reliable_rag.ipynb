      "Content: a single step or with a single tool invocation, but an agent can decide what steps to take. For example, to simplify an example from the HuggingGPT paper (cited below), if you want an agent to consider a picture of a boy and draw a picture of a girl in the same pose, the task might be decomposed into two distinct steps: (i) detect the pose in the picture of the boy and (ii) render a picture of a girl in the detected pose. An LLM might be fine-tuned or prompted (with few-shot prompting) to specify a plan by outputting a string like \"{tool: pose-detection, input: image.jpg, output: temp1 } {tool: pose-to-image, input: temp1, output: final.jpg}\". This structured output, which specifies two steps to take, then triggers software to invoke a pose detection tool followed by a pose-to-image tool to complete the task. (This example is for illustrative purposes only; HuggingGPT uses a different format.) Admittedly, many agentic workflows do not need planning. For example, you might have an agent reflect on, and improve, its output a fixed number of times. In this case, the sequence of steps the agent takes is fixed and deterministic. But for complex tasks in which you aren’t able to specify a decomposition of the task into a set of steps ahead of time, Planning allows the agent to decide dynamically what steps to take. On one hand, Planning is a very powerful capability; on the other, it leads to less predictable results. In my experience, while I can get the agentic design patterns of Reflection and Tool Use to work reliably and improve my applications’ performance, Planning is a less mature technology, and I find it hard to predict in advance what it will do. But the field continues to evolve rapidly, and I'm confident that Planning abilities will improve quickly. If you’re interested in learning more about Planning with LLMs, I recommend:“Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models,” Wei et al.

This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it.Today, we mostly use LLMs in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate final output token by token without revising its work. This is akin to asking someone to compose an essay from start to finish, typing straight through with no backspacing allowed, and expecting a high-quality result. Despite the difficulty, LLMs do amazingly well at this task! With an agent workflow, however, we can ask the LLM to iterate over a document many times. For example, it might take a sequence of steps such as:Plan an outline.Decide what, if any, web searches are needed to gather more information.Write a first draft.Read over the first draft to spot unjustified arguments or extraneous information.Revise the draft taking into account any weaknesses spotted.And so on.This iterative process is critical for most human writers to write good text. With AI, such an iterative workflow yields much better results than writing in a single pass. Devin’s splashy demo recently received a lot of social media buzz. My team has been closely following the evolution of AI that writes code. We analyzed results from a number of research teams, focusing on an algorithm’s ability to do well on the widely used HumanEval coding benchmark. You can see our findings in the diagram below. GPT-3.5 (zero shot) was 48.1% correct. GPT-4 (zero shot) does better at 67.0%. However, the improvement from \n",

      "(1+0.07)**12 to get the right answer. The LLM might generate a string like this: {tool: python-interpreter, code: \"100 * (1+0.07)**12\"}. But Tool Use in agentic workflows now goes much further. Developers are using functions to search different sources (web, Wikipedia, arXiv, etc.), to interface with productivity tools (send email, read/write calendar entries, etc.), generate or interpret images, and much more. We can prompt an LLM using context that gives detailed descriptions of many functions. These descriptions might include a text description of what the function does plus details of what arguments the function expects. And we’d expect the LLM to automatically choose the right function to call to do a job. Further, systems are being built in which the LLM has access to hundreds of tools. In such settings, there might be too many functions at your disposal to put all of them into the LLM context, so you might use heuristics to pick the most relevant subset to include in the LLM context at the current step of processing. This technique, which is described in the Gorilla paper cited below, is reminiscent of how, if there is too much text to include as context, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems offer heuristics for picking a subset of the text to include. Early in the history of LLMs, before widespread availability of large multimodal models (LMMs)  like LLaVa, GPT-4V, and Gemini, LLMs could not process images directly, so a lot of work on Tool Use was carried out by the computer vision community. At that time, the only way for an LLM-based system to manipulate an image was by calling a function to, say, carry out object recognition or some other function on it. Since then, practices for Tool Use have exploded. GPT-4’s function calling capability, released in the middle of last year, was a significant step toward a general-purpose implementation. Since then, more and more LLMs are being developed to be similarly facile with Tool Use. If you’re interested in learning more about Tool Use, I recommend: “Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs,” Patil et al. \n",

Given a complex task like writing software, a multi-agent approach would break down the task into subtasks to be executed by different roles — such as a software engineer, product manager, designer, QA (quality assurance) engineer, and so on — and have different agents accomplish different subtasks.Different agents might be built by prompting one LLM (or, if you prefer, multiple LLMs) to carry out different tasks. For example, to build a software engineer agent, we might prompt the LLM: “You are an expert in writing clear, efficient code. Write code to perform the task . . ..” It might seem counterintuitive that, although we are making multiple calls to the same LLM, we apply the programming abstraction of using multiple agents. I’d like to offer a few reasons:It works! Many teams are getting good results with this method, and there’s nothing like results! Further, ablation studies (for example, in the AutoGen paper cited below) show that multiple agents give superior performance to a single agent. Even though some LLMs today can accept very long input contexts (for instance, Gemini 1.5 Pro accepts 1 million tokens), their ability to truly understand long, complex inputs is mixed. An agentic workflow in which the LLM is prompted to focus on one thing at a time can give better performance. By telling it when it should play software engineer, we can also specify what is important in that role’s subtask. For example, the prompt above emphasized clear, efficient code as \n",

For example, to simplify an example from the HuggingGPT paper (cited below), if you want an agent to consider a picture of a boy and draw a picture of a girl in the same pose, the task might be decomposed into two distinct steps: (i) detect the pose in the picture of the boy and (ii) render a picture of a girl in the detected pose. An LLM might be fine-tuned or prompted (with few-shot prompting) to specify a plan by outputting a string like\\xa0\"{tool: pose-detection, input: image.jpg, output: temp1 } {tool: pose-to-image, input: temp1, output: final.jpg}\".\\xa0This structured output, which specifies two steps to take, then triggers software to invoke a pose detection tool followed by a pose-to-image tool to complete the task. (This example is for illustrative purposes only; HuggingGPT uses a different format.)\\xa0Admittedly, many agentic workflows do not need planning. For example, you might have an agent reflect on, and improve, its output a fixed number of times. In this case, the sequence of steps the agent takes is fixed and deterministic. But for complex tasks in which you aren’t able to specify a decomposition of the task into a set of steps ahead of time, Planning allows the agent to decide dynamically what steps to take.\\xa0On one hand, Planning is a very powerful capability; on the other, it leads to less predictable results. In my experience, while I can get the agentic design patterns of\\xa0Reflection\\xa0and\\xa0Tool Use\\xa0to work reliably and improve my applications’ performance, Planning is a less mature technology, and I find it hard to predict in advance what it will do. But the field continues to evolve rapidly, and I\\'m confident that Planning abilities will improve quickly.\\xa0If you’re interested in learning more about Planning with LLMs, I recommend:“Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models,” Wei et al.

This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it.Today, we mostly use LLMs in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate final output token by token without revising its work. This is akin to asking someone to compose an essay from start to finish, typing straight through with no backspacing allowed, and expecting a high-quality result. Despite the difficulty, LLMs do amazingly well at this task!\\xa0With an agent workflow, however, we can ask the LLM to iterate over a document many times. For example, it might take a sequence of steps such as:Plan an outline.Decide what, if any, web searches are needed to gather more information.Write a first draft.Read over the first draft to spot unjustified arguments or extraneous information.Revise the draft taking into account any weaknesses spotted.And so on.This iterative process is critical for most human writers to write good text. With AI, such an iterative workflow yields much better results than writing in a single pass.\\xa0Devin’s splashy demo recently received a lot of social media buzz. My team has been closely following the evolution of AI that writes code. We analyzed results from a number of research teams, focusing on an algorithm’s ability to do well on the widely used HumanEval coding benchmark. You can see our findings in the diagram below.\\xa0GPT-3.5 (zero shot) was 48.1% correct. GPT-4 (zero shot) does better at 67.0%.

Given a complex task like writing software, a multi-agent approach would break down the task into subtasks to be executed by different roles — such as a software engineer, product manager, designer, QA (quality assurance) engineer, and so on — and have different agents accomplish different subtasks.Different agents might be built by prompting one LLM (or, if you prefer, multiple LLMs) to carry out different tasks. For example, to build a software engineer agent, we might prompt the LLM: “You are an expert in writing clear, efficient code. Write code to perform the task . . ..”\\xa0It might seem counterintuitive that, although we are making multiple calls to the same LLM, we apply the programming abstraction of using multiple agents. I’d like to offer a few reasons:It works! Many teams are getting good results with this method, and there’s nothing like results! Further, ablation studies (for example, in the AutoGen paper cited below) show that multiple agents give superior performance to a single agent.\\xa0Even though some LLMs today can accept very long input contexts (for instance, Gemini 1.5 Pro accepts 1 million tokens), their ability to truly understand long, complex inputs is mixed. An agentic workflow in which the LLM is prompted to focus on one thing at a time can give better performance. By telling it when it should play software engineer, we can also specify what is important in that role’s subtask. For example, the prompt above emphasized clear, efficient code as\\n</doc3>\\n'"
